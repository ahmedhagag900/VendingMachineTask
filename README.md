# VendingMachineTask
The task is to implement a vending machine operations and expose it with RESTFull APIs<br>
Allowing users with a ```seller``` role to add, update or remove products,<br> 
while users with a ```buyer``` role can deposit coins into the machine and make purchases. <br>
Vending machine should only accept 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cent coins

## Requirements
- Implement CRUD for users (POST dose not require authentication).
- Implement CRUD for a product model (GET can be called by anyone, while POST, PUT and DELETE can be called only by the seller user who created the
product)
- Deposit endpoint so users with a ```buyer``` role can deposit 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cent coins into their vending machine account.
- Buy endpoint so users with a ```buyer``` role can buy products with the money theyâ€™ve deposited.

## System Architecture
- Used the clean/onion archituctre to implement the soultion. 
- Implement the CQRS pattern to sperate commands from queries.
- Implement unit of work to ensure the data consistancy & integrity.

## Authentication & Authorizations
- Used JWT scheme to authenticate users
- Used policy builder to build role check policy 

## Validations
- Used fluent validation to validate api requests for basic validations
- Used business rule validation to validate on business validation like (unique username, user exists ,etc..)

## Technologies
- C#
- NET 6
- EF 7
- SQL Server

## How To Run
 - The application has some seed data to quick start it if you dont need to seed any data comment the seed line in the following snapshot in ```program.cs``` file <br><br>

 - Note that the database must have role data seeded in the database to run probably so do not comment the ```SeedRoleAsync``` line.
 - you can run the application using sql server database or in memory database.
 
### SQL Server Database
- you need to create database named ```VendingMachine``` 
- change the connection string property in ```appsettings.Development.json``` <br> <br>

- build and run the application

### In Memory Database
- If you do not need to create databse or do not have sql server database you can run the app with in memory database 
- change the flags in the following snapshots to true in ```program.cs``` file <br> <br>

- After configuring your datastore you can use dotnet cli or vs2022 to run the application
- To run using the dotnet cli type ```dotnet run``` in ```FlapKap.API``` project folder
- After success run you can open your browser to the listening port and append ```/swagger``` to open swager ui.
